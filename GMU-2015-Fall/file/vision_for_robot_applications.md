## Vision for Robot Applications

- Date: 2015/10/30
- Speaker: Henrik I Christensen @ Georgia Tech

### Converge
- automating the supply chain
- empowering companies

### Co-Woker Roadmap
- how does it related to daily life
- corobots

### Challenges
- textures or not
- clutter
  - unstructured environments
  - false measurements
  - false pose estimates
  - stuck in local minima
  - no table-top assumption

### Applications
- robot to clean, organize the room
- depth sensor
- robot aseembly
- healthcare

### Resources
- Google 3D warehouse (about 2.5m objects)
- 3D model in Ikea

### Simplify model to track objects
- some edges are not important
  - remove the edges to make model simple
- combine key points and edge features
  - effective number of particle size

- by David Wang, MIT

### Intro
- Planning for uncertainty, planning with change constraints

### tBurton: planning with Controllable Durations
- Planning with probability constraints, uncertainty

### Rubato: checking the consistency of Plans with Probabilistic Durations and Change constraints
- Solve controllable constraints incrementally

### Temporal Landmarks: What must have
- Landmarks in classical Planning
	- a landmark is a logical formula over the propositions which must hold in all valid plans at some point
- Temporal Landmarks
	- include the temporal information into landmark and define two types of landmark
		- a temporal fact landmark 
		- a temporal action landmark
	- instead for ordering. they maintain a set of simple temporal constraints between the time point variables of the landmark
- Valid Landmarks
	- if for any schedule, there exists a mapping...
- Non-temporal landmark
- Example Problem: Temporal Landmarks
	- The goal must hold from some point tg until the end

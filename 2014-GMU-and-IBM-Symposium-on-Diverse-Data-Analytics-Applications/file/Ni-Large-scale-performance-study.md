## Applications of Advanced Analytics in a Large-Scale Performance Measurement Study

- Speaker: Hua Ni, IBM

### Background
- the mail transit time study is a large-scale study, i.e., measure delivery time
	- all market dominant mail product
	- 892 ZIP3s, 67 districts, 7 postal areas

### Simulation
- design a Monte Carlo simulation program to evaluate which designation is likely to yield better induction coverage
- create a set of regression models, refreshed each quarter to forecast district level usability
- leverage the linear regression confidence level and the historical projection errors for the individual district to create an individualized buffer for each district 

### Induction Schedule OPtimization
- objective: minimization the induction days and the weighted total of soft constraints violations
- constraints
	- al mail must be inducted
	- inductions must occur on every day of quarter except weekends

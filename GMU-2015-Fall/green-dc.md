###ã€€Main characteristic of a DC
- what is dc
  - IT equipment, power delivery, and backup
- how large are they?
  - machine rooms in commercial buildings
- what workloads
  - high-performance computing and data analytics (batch)
  - online services (interactive)
  - virtual machine

### Overview
- microsoft dc in Quicy, WA
- google DC in mayes county
- high-level view

### Energy Consumption
- aggregate DC energy consumption
  - *small and medium dta centers currently dominate* 
  - data center consumes 2% of worldwide electricity consumption
  - in 2005-2010, the consumption is not double mainly due to reception, and virtualization
- thus need renewable energy in a DC
- PUE
  - PUE = total power/IT power
  - enterprise data center PUES are not improving much over time
  - for comparison, microsoft's new data centers have an average PUE of 1.125
- where does power go in a DC
  - power delivery
  - cooling
  - IT equipment
- IT power in 2007 for google DC
  - cpu: 33%
  - dram: 30%
  - networking: 5%
  - misc: 22%
- IT power in 2012 for google DC
  - cpu: 42%
  - dram: 12%
  - networking: 5%
  - misc: 27%
- what we can see
  - as technology involves, the key tarets for optimization may change. the CPU dominate right now.
- where does the money go
  - server: 63%
  - networking equipment: 6%
  - power distribution and cooling; 17%
  - other infrastructure: 4%
  - energy: 10%
- Thus we can see that energy is significant expense (180$) but pruchasing servers dominate.
  - fewer servers reduce energy cost

### Past and present techniques for greening DC
- Conventional DC cooling: cold/hot aisles
  - temperatre of the cold aisle at 20c or below
  - significant potential for hot air recirculation
  - the cooling infrastructure consumes a lot of energy

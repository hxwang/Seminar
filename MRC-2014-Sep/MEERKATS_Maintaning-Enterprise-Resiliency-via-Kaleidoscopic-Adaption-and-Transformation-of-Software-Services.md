MEERKATS-Maintaining EnterprisE Resiliency via Kaleidoscopic Adaption & Transformation of Software Services

- by *Roxana Geambasy*, Columbia University

### Overall
- Increase cloud resilience by building unpredictability, confusion, and continuous changes into cloud infrastructure
	- Diversity replication execution
	- Miss
	-
	-
- website, windtunnel

### Stable Multithreading
- Challenge
	- too many possible interleavings(aka, schedules)
		- for programmers to reason about
		- for tests to cover
		- for tools to check
- New threading runtime that constraints schedules
	- turns out you can map input values into a few schedules
- Benefits
	- checking tools get more coverage
	- tests will have higher chance of revealing the bug


### Moving target DDoS defense(MiSS)
- Treat Model
	- a website requires no authentication
- Shuffling
	- Dynamic programming, greedy
- System architecture
- Runtime overhead

### DMCC: distributed monitrong and crosschecking 
- Alerts Correlation
	- Cross-site correlation: dynamic path problem in the cloud
	- Cross-layer correlation: defense in depth
	- Cross-sensor correlation: detection performance
- Cross-site Correlation
- Wind Tunnel Architecture
- Measurement: CDF and ROC curve across datasets
	- test on worldexpress has less than 1% false positive rate

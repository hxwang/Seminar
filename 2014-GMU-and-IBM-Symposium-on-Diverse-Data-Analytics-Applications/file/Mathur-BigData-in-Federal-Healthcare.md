## Using Advanced Analytics with Big Data in Federal/Healthcare

- Speaker: Rashmi Mathur, IBM

### Systematic approach 
- implement the CRoss Industry Standard Process for data mining(CRISP) for predictive modeling
	- **business understanding**: identify and prioritize the goals of predictive modeling
	- **data understanding**: identify data to investigate in the predictive modeling
	- **data preparation**: transform and prepare data for modeling
	- **modeling**: applying various analytic techniques to develop predictive models and tests performance
	- **evaluation**: access, refine and validate the model
	- **deployment**: moving new models into production
	
### Toolkits
- merging some market data 
- interpretation of unstructured data

### Realize value from analytics investments
- Enable
	- source of value
	- measurement 
	- platform
- Drive
	- culture
	- data
	- trust
- Amplify
	- sponsorship...
	
### Case Study 1
improve risk and cost management for a large health plan
- business problem
	- how to I predict enrolment
	- how do I predict end of year costs with no claims dates
	- what is the impact of different population mix on expected cost
- data 
	- external data
	- ...
- business solution
	- population analytics
		- estimate market cost and opportunities before the enrolment play out different `cost scenarios?`
	- enrolment cost model
		- predict future cost at the time of enrolment with greater accuracy and confidence
	- high cost individual model
		- identify high cost individuals before they come onboard
	- early claim cost model
		- refine the predictions with early claims
	- clustering
		- assign members into cost-differentiated population segments
- business benefits
	- enable risk measurement or members
	- ...
	
### Case Study 2
social security administration: streamlining the disability application and review process
- Problem
	- how do we reduce the backlog of new disability applications that needed to be processed, `backlog`
	- how do we improve the process for performing doctor reviews continuing disability review(CDR) which are expensive
	
### My comments
- learn how machine learning applied in industry and their standard procedure of machine learning

## Performance Engineering for the Internet of Things

### Abstract
Originally coined to describe networked RFID tags, the Internet of Things (IoT) now commonly refers to global systems of communicating IP-friendly objects. Even after taking into account the hype surrounding the label, proposed IoT systems are expected to require tens of billions of devices, dwarfing current Internet deployments. For these systems to reach their true potential a careful balance must be struck between producing extremely inexpensive and resource constrained devices while simultaneously designing protocols and system software that provide high levels of predictable performance. In this talk I describe recent work in IoT technologies that address this balance, including routing protocols, control plane management and
energy harvesting methods. I also discuss future applications in areas such as smart spaces, smart grids and semi-autonomous systems

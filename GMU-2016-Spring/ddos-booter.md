## DDoS Booter

- PHD Defense by Mohammad Karami

### Booter Service

- Use the interface 
- Techniques
  - Direct attacks
    - TCP SYN, UDP flood etc
  - Reflexive Attacks
    - DNS, NTP, SSDP ...
    
### Amplification Attacks
- Booter's preferred attack technique
- Most frequently abused protocol for amplification
  - NTP: 603
  - DNS: 30x
  - SSDP: 26x
  

### Payment
- botcoin
- ebay
  - Collaborated with Paypal to limit access of booters

### Attribution of Booter Amplification Attacks
- Jaccard index to measuring the similarity of attack instances
  - use a similarity threshold value to account for unknown attack instances (how to decide the threshold?)
- "leave one out" cross validation (discuss with Xi)

### Evasion Attempts
- Randomizing the set of abused amplification per attack
- Masquerading as a different booter service

### EDoS
- Motivation
  - Target public cloud consumers
  - The goal is to increase the cost for a victim
  - Do not cause service distruption
  - Carrided out using botnets
  - Need to run over an extended period of time

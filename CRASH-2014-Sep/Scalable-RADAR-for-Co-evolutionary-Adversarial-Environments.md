Scalable RADAR for Co-evolutionary Adversarial Environments
--- 

- by *Stephanie Forrest*, University of New Mexico

### Biological Modeling
- Adaptive movement is more important 
- automatically program repair

### Search via Robert Agents
- distributed adaptive search

### V-DIFT
- vector-based dynamic information flow tracking
- locating cryptographic keys and algorithms
	- semantic distance
- memory-based tainting
	- v.s., tainting on file input
- Linux kernel side channel

### Locating cryptographic keys
- A^T * A
- measuring diversity
	- AES, DES

### Memory-based Tainting

### Linux Kernel side channel
- semantic distance v.s. "weird machines"
	- from buffer overflow to "weird machines"
